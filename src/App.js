        "If you want action, you'll definitely find it at Kovalam Beach‚Äîthe most popular and most developed beach in Kerala. Often likened to Goa's Calangute and Baga beaches, Kovalam is located not far from the capital, Trivandrum. It's actually made up of two main coves‚ÄîHawa (also referred to as Eve's Beach) and Lighthouse Beach. Lighthouse is the biggest and busiest of the two, with its promenade lined with open-air restaurants. Kovalam is a popular surfing destination in India. If you'd prefer somewhere a little more secluded, you'll find nearby Samudra Beach to be a better option.",

Although more and more tourists are flocking there every year, it's still less crowded than Kovalam and the scenery is striking. The beach lies at the bottom of a long stretch of cliff that's bordered by beach shacks and shops. You can stay right on the cliff, overlooking the ocean, or set back from it. It's incredibly romantic! Lots of young foreigners and couples enjoy this beach.",
